              With a solid foundation in Health, Safety, and Environmental
              management, I bring years of experience to the table, helping
              organizations navigate complex safety regulations and create safer
              work environments. <br />
              My mission is to foster a culture of safety and environmental
              responsibility. I am committed to providing solutions that not
              only meet but exceed industry standards, ensuring a safer,
              healthier workplace for all <br />
              I’m a prolific project and asset manager who has mastered the art
              of discipline and time-management. I excel in different areas in
              terms of attitude, initiative, project delivery and human
              relations management. As a highly proficient and diligent HSE
              professional, I have honed my skills on leadership, initiative,
              team building, accident investigation, safety audits, policy
              implementations, to mention a few, which is reflective in my
              ability to have overseen several projects with zero fatalities,
              higher productivity ratio while ensuring maximum cognizance and
              implementation of proper Health and Safety practices.
              Interestingly, I am able to thrive in any given environment,
              having worked with a vast number of individuals from different
              countries and background. I also derive maximum satisfaction from
              youth mentorships and knowledge sharing and have helped several
              youths find their foots on life/career-related choices and
              challenges. I strongly believe that I am an exceptional asset to
              any organization I am privileged to work with.

                    is my distinct pleasure to wholeheartedly recommend Felicia
                    for her exemplary contributions as a Health, Safety, and
                    Environment (HSE) professional. I had the privilege of
                    collaborating closely with Felicia both in the Apani and
                    Atamba field locations, and throughout our time together,
                    she consistently showcased an unwavering commitment to
                    excellence. Felicia's dedication to her role is truly
                    commendable. With meticulous attention to detail and a
                    proactive mindset, she ensures that safety protocols are not
                    only met but exceeded in every aspect of our operations. Her
                    astute ability to identify and mitigate potential hazards
                    has been instrumental in fostering a culture of safety and
                    well-being within our team, whether amidst the challenges of
                    Apani or Atamba. What sets Felicia apart is her relentless
                    pursuit of excellence. She sets ambitious goals for herself
                    and her team, pushing the boundaries to achieve and surpass
                    safety benchmarks. Her efforts have been pivotal in our
                    organization's journey towards zero Lost Time Incidents
                    (LTI), a testament to her effectiveness in upholding the
                    highest standards of safety performance. Moreover, Felicia
                    possesses exceptional communication skills, which she
                    adeptly utilizes to convey complex safety information with
                    clarity and precision. Her ability to engage and educate our
                    workforce has significantly contributed to heightened safety
                    awareness and compliance across all levels of the
                    organization. In conclusion, Felicia's diligence,
                    intelligence, and eloquence make her an invaluable asset to
                    any HSE-related endeavor. It has been both a privilege and a
                    pleasure to work alongside her in the challenging
                    environments of Apani and Atamba. I am confident that
                    Felicia will continue to excel in her future endeavors,
                    leaving an indelible mark wherever her career may take her.

                    I had the pleasure of working closely with Felicia Fred on
                    various complex projects such are Overhauling of 220MW steam

                    assessing complex OHS issues, developing practical
                    solutions, and ensuring their smooth implementation. Part of
                    what speaks volume for her in the course of these projects
                    was her demonstrated outstanding interpersonal skills,

                    teams and stakeholders, her ability to communicate OHS
